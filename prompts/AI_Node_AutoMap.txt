Your task is to map xLights lighting effects on sourceModels to targetModels.
Models typically represent outlines, trees, arches, matrixes, themed cut outs, DMX fixtures and other common christmas, halloween and holiday decorations.
Models contain nodes which are also known as pixels or lights.
In this mapping all targetModels and sourceModels are nodes.
Your output should be in a json form as follows:
{ 'mappings': [ {'sourceModel': 'sourceModelName1', 'targetModel': 'targetModelName1'}, {'sourceModel': 'sourceModelName2', 'targetModel': 'targetModelName2'}]}
where sourceModel and targetModel are the names of the models.
Only the json should be provided. Do not explain your answer or workings.

When mapping models you should:

    - You should work out which order you should map the models first and only then do the mapping. This will produce a better result.
    - Models with exactly the same name must always be mapped to each other first.
    - Map models with a larger effectCount second.
    - Map models to similar types and/or classes where possible.
    - Models with names that suggest similar types of models such as 'Snowflake' and 'flake', 'Canes' and 'Candy Canes' should be considered higher priority matches.
    - Target models should only be mapped to one source model.
    - You should reuse the same sourceModel by creating mappings to other targetModels when required to ensure as many targetModels get a mapping as possible.
    - Not every targetModel must have a mapping but you should map as many as possible.
    - Not every sourceModel must have a mapping.
	- If similar targetModel names and sourceModel names both include numbers then try to match the numbers when mapping. eg 'MH1/Strand 1/Node 3' might map to 'Moving Head/Strand 1/ Node 3'.
    - Node numbers should match the sourceModel to the targetModel.
	- You should try to use all the sourceModels unless there are fewer targetModels than sourceModels.
	- Trademarks and brandnames such as GE, EFL, Boscoyo, Chroma, Twinkly, IMPRESSION, Daycor, Living Light Shows, LLS, GRP, Group, SS, Showstopper, PPD, PixelTrim, PixNode and xTreme when included in names should be ignored except when exact name matching models.

The source models are represented in this XML structure:
{sourcemodels}

The target models are represented in this XML structure:
{targetmodels}

As an example of node mappings these are the mappings that have already been done (if any):
