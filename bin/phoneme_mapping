# This file contains a mapping between the CMU phoneme set to the phoneme set
# you use for animating. By default the animation phoneme set is the Preston
# Blair phoneme set as found in the book
# "Cartoon Animation" by Preston Blair page 186.

# If you want to use a different set of phonemes than Preston Blair just
# modify the two tables below. The first table contains the basic list of
# phonemes to use in your animation. The second table contains a mapping
# from the CMU phonemes to the phonemes in the first table.
